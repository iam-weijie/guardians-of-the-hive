# Tower Defense Game

This is a game about Bees vs Hornets.

Run `BeeColony` to play ;)

## Character Description
### Honey Bees

- ***Busy Bees***. Bees that collect pollen.
- ***Angry Bees***. Our private soldiers. These bees fly around stinging single enemies at melee range.

### Special Units
- ***Fire Bees***. These bees have the ability to launch fire projectiles at tiles within a specified range from their position, causing those tiles to catch fire. This results in ongoing damage affecting the entire swarm situated on those tiles.
- ***Sniper Bees***. These bees are highly skilled marksbees, armed with a long-range stinger enabling them to eliminate hornets from a distance with precision. Their two-step attack involves aiming before releasing a potent shot that pierces through multiple hornets in a straight line, effectively reducing approaching swarms. While incredibly powerful, their slower rate of fire and vulnerability at close range necessitate strategic placement to optimize their effectiveness. 

- ***Hornet Queen***. Almost twice the length of an average hornet, the leader of the hornets commands fear. With astonishing speed, she can execute two attacks within the time it takes a regular hornet to launch just one. Furthermore, when this formidable leader enters the battlefield, the entire swarm experiences a significant morale boost, resulting in rapid health regeneration.
